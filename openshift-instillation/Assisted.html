      <li>Arbiter nodes are a more cost-effective alternative to control plane nodes. They function similarly but run only the essential components required to maintain the etcd quorum and prevent a split-brain condition. Because they do not host the full control plane or any workloads, arbiter nodes can use less powerful hardware.</li>

  <li>To determine the most suitable role, the Assisted Installer evaluates each host’s memory, CPU, disk space, and network performance. It assigns an internal <code>suggested_role</code> value to each host, which drives the auto-assignment process when auto-assigned is enabled. Pre-installation validations ensure the resulting role allocation is valid.</li>
