<h1>What is OVN</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The OVN-Kubernetes plugin watches the Kubernetes API. It <mark class="marker-yellow">acts on the generated Kubernetes cluster events by creating and configuring the corresponding OVN logical constructs</mark> in the <mark class="marker-yellow">OVN database</mark> for those events.</li>
</ul>
