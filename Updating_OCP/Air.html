<h1>Updates</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Red&nbsp;Hat released a new software distribution system that provides the upgrade path to update your cluster and the underlying operating system, which enable over-the-air updates</li>
  <li>This distrusted system manages the <mark class="marker-yellow">controller manifests</mark>, cluster roles, and any other resources to update a cluster to a particular version.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Red&nbsp;Hat hosts and manages this service at <a href="https://console.redhat.com/openshift">https://console.redhat.com/openshift</a>, and hosts cluster images at <a href="https://quay.io/">https://quay.io</a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><i><strong>upgrade paths</strong>: the allowed updates for a cluster in a certain channel (stable, fast, candidateâ€¦etc), which depends on the duration of subscription and other metrics that are sent to the OTA updates system by cluster telemetric system.</i></li>
  <li><strong>update channels</strong>: Controls the frequency and stability of updates, depending on the existence of bugs in new releases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>A channel name consists of the following parts: the tier (release candidate, fast, stable, and extended update support), the major version (<code>4</code>), and the minor version (<code>.12</code>).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Red Hat does not offer major-version, in-place upgrades. Similar to the process for upgrading from <mark class="marker-yellow">OpenShift 2 to OpenShift 3</mark>, moving between major versions of OpenShift will require a fresh installation and a migration of applications.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>OTA policy engine: </strong>Determine the upgrade paths</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>the question here is that why are we using a general tool to determine the upgrade path for a cluster?? Is not that supposed to be generated according the metrics that the cluster sends to the OTA engine?&nbsp;</p>
