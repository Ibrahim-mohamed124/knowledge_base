<h1>Updates</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Red&nbsp;Hat released a new software distribution system that provides the upgrade path to update your cluster and the underlying operating system, which enable over-the-air updates</li>
  <li>This distrusted system manages the <mark class="marker-yellow">controller manifests</mark>, cluster roles, and any other resources to update a cluster to a particular version.</li>
  <li>Red&nbsp;Hat hosts and manages this service at <a href="https://console.redhat.com/openshift">https://console.redhat.com/openshift</a>, and hosts cluster images at <a href="https://quay.io/">https://quay.io</a>.</li>
  <li><i><strong>upgrade paths</strong>: the allowed updates for a cluster in a certain channel (stable, fast, candidate…etc), which depends on the duration of subscription and other metrics that are sent to the OTA updates system by cluster telemetric system.</i></li>
  <li><strong>update channels</strong>: Controls the frequency and stability of updates, depending on the existence of bugs in new releases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>A channel name consists of the following parts: the tier (release candidate, fast, stable, and extended update support), the major version (<code>4</code>), and the minor version (<code>.12</code>).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Red Hat does not offer major-version, in-place upgrades. Similar to the process for upgrading from <mark class="marker-yellow">OpenShift 2 to OpenShift 3</mark>, moving between major versions of OpenShift will require a fresh installation and a migration of applications.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>OTA policy engine: </strong>Determine the upgrade paths</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>the question here is that why are we using a general tool to determine the upgrade path for a cluster?? Is not that supposed to be generated according the metrics that the cluster sends to the OTA engine?&nbsp;</p>

  <h3><strong>Update Path</strong></h3>
  <p>An update path is a <strong>validated transition</strong> from one OpenShift version to another.</p>
  <p>It can be:</p>
  <p><strong>Z-stream</strong>: 4.16.1 → 4.16.2 (within the same channel)</p>
  <p><strong>Minor version jump</strong>: 4.16.2 → 4.17.0 (requires switching to <code>stable-4.17</code>)</p>
  <p>Red Hat defines these paths in the <strong>OpenShift Update Graph</strong>, ensuring safety and compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Upgrade Paths</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You can apply each of the upgrade channels to a Red&nbsp;Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.14 cluster in different environments. The following paragraphs describe an example scenario where the<mark class="marker-yellow"> 4.14.3 version has a defect.</mark></li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Stable channel:&nbsp;</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When using the <code>stable-4.14</code> channel, you can upgrade your cluster from 4.14.0 to 4.14.1 or to 4.14.2. If an issue is discovered in the 4.14.3 release, then you cannot upgrade to that version. When a patch becomes available in the 4.14.4 release, you can update your cluster to that version.</li>
      <li>This channel is suited to production environments, because the Red&nbsp;Hat SRE teams and support services test the releases in that channel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Fast channel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>fast-4.14</code> channel can deliver 4.14.1 and 4.14.2 updates but not 4.14.3. Red&nbsp;Hat also supports this channel, and you can apply it to development, QA, or production environments.</li>
      <li>Administrators must<mark class="marker-yellow"> specifically choose a different minor version channel,</mark> such as <code>fast-4.14</code>, <mark class="marker-yellow">to upgrade to a new release in a new minor version when it becomes available.</mark></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Candidate channel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You can use the <code>candidate-4.14</code> channel to install the latest features of OpenShift. With this channel, you can upgrade to all <i>z-stream</i> releases, such as 4.14.1, 4.14.2, and 4.14.3.</li>
      <li>You use this channel to access the latest features of the product as they get released. This channel is suited to development and pre-production environments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>EUS channel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When switching to the <code>eus-4.14</code> channel, the <code>stable-4.14</code> channel does not receive <i>z-stream</i> updates until the next EUS version becomes available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>To ensure the stability of the cluster and the proper level of support, switch only from a <i>stable</i> channel to a <i>fast</i> channel. Although it is possible to<mark class="marker-yellow"> switch from a </mark><i><mark class="marker-yellow">stable</mark></i><mark class="marker-yellow"> channel or a </mark><i><mark class="marker-yellow">fast</mark></i><mark class="marker-yellow"> channel to a </mark><i><mark class="marker-yellow">candidate</mark></i><mark class="marker-yellow"> channel, it is not recommended</mark></p>
