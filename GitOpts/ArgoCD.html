<h1>What is GitOps</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Without GitOps operations that done manually in clusters will lead to a configuration drift, which could lead to down time in the service.</li>
  <li>GitOps is a framework where the entire code deliver process is controlled by git allowing to do rollbacks, operations, and releases seamlessly</li>
  <li>It extends the IaCs to use Git as a control system with the source code of the applications</li>
  <li>GitOps operator like ArgoCD continuously compare the actual state to the state exist in Git</li>
</ul>
<h4>Principles&nbsp;</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Declarative vs imperative.</li>
  <li>Git as source of the truth</li>
  <li>Software agents (GitOps operators) pull the state from Git and apply it to the target platform</li>
  <li>Reconciliation loops for self-healing (observe-diff-act)</li>
</ol>
<h4>DevOps vs GitOps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>DevOps works with any application, but GitOps works best with containerized applications. DevOps push the changes to the target platform unlike the GitOps operator that usually &nbsp;pulls the state.</li>
  <li>GitOps usually has two repos &nbsp;one for source code and another for the IaC files.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The DevOps pipeline will build the container image, pulls the manifests from the IaC repo, and then it modified the manifests with the tag of the created image and push the modified files to the Iac repo.</li>
  <li>The GitOps operator will pull the state from the IaC repo and apply them to the target platform.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
