<h3>Sync Hooks and Sync Waves</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Using both these features, we can create deployment playbooks to define the chorological relationship between resources in the aspect of creation, updating, and deleting.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Depend mainly on annotating &nbsp;the manifests to categorize them into groups</li>
</ul>
<h6>Sync Hooks</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Jobs run during the deployment to do certain functions &gt;&gt; &nbsp;<mark class="marker-yellow">argocd.argoproj.io/hook:</mark>
    <ul>
      <li>PreSync: run before the main sync to prepare &nbsp;for the sync</li>
      <li>Sync: resources deployment</li>
      <li>PostSync: after deploying the resources</li>
      <li>SyncFail: in case the main sync failed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These jobs are not cleaned automatically, so you have to use a clean up strategy for each job. <mark class="marker-yellow">argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy:&nbsp;</mark>
    <ul>
      <li>HookSuccedded: only delete the job only if it successful&nbsp;</li>
      <li>HookFailed: keep successful jobs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
