<h3>Sync Hooks and Sync Waves</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Using both these features, we can create deployment playbooks to define the chorological relationship between resources in the aspect of creation, updating, and deleting.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Depend mainly on annotating &nbsp;the manifests to categorize them into groups</li>
</ul>
<h6>Sync Hooks</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Jobs run during the deployment to do certain functions<ul>
      <li>PreSync: run before the main sync to prepare &nbsp;for the sync</li>
      <li>Sync: resources deployment</li>
      <li>PostSync: after deploying the resources</li>
      <li>SyncFail: in case the main sync failed&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
