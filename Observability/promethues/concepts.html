<h1>Intro to Observability</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to understand and measure the state of a system based upon data generated by the system</li>
  <li>It allows to generate actionable outputs from unexpected scenarios in dynamic environments and help in<ul>
      <li>Better insights into the internal working of a system</li>
      <li>speed up troubleshooting</li>
      <li>Monitor performance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unlike monolithic application microservices applications are much more complex</li>
  <li>it gives us answers for<ul>
      <li>error rates</li>
      <li>high latency</li>
      <li>timing outs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Pillars of Observability</h3>
<ol>
  <li>logging:<ul>
      <li>Records of events that have occurred and encapsulated information about the specific event with timestamps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>metrics:<ul>
      <li>numeric data about the system that contain:<ul>
          <li>Metric name</li>
          <li>Value of the metric</li>
          <li>Timestamp</li>
          <li>Dimensions: more data about the mertic</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Traces:<ul>
      <li>allow to follow operations as they traverses through various systems &amp; services hop by hop to understand the whole picture<ul>
          <li>trace ID: the unique id for a trace</li>
          <li>Spans: evens in the trace and contain start time of the span, duration, and parent id</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Quality of Service indicators</h3>
<ol>
  <li>measurable targets/goals to help organizations strike the right balance between product development and operations work.<ul>
      <li>SLI: service level indicator is a quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided like request latency, error rate, saturation, throughput, and availability.<ul>
          <li>Metrics that accurately measure the user's experience.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>SLO: service level objective - target value or range &nbsp;of an SLI</li>
      <li>SLA: service level agreement: &nbsp;Contract between end user and provider to meet the SLO</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Prometheus</h2>
<h3>Use cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>collect metrics from many datacenters</li>
  <li>alerting when conditions are met</li>
  <li>scrape and do operations in metrics.</li>
  <li>data charting</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prometheus collects metrics by scraping targets who expose metrics through an HTTP endpoint</li>
  <li>Store the scraped metrics into time based database</li>
</ul>
<h6>Architecture</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Data retrieval workers: &nbsp;scrape the data from the target endpoints by sending http requests ( pulling metrics )</li>
  <li>TSDB: &nbsp;stores the metric data</li>
  <li>HTTP server: accepts PromeQL Query</li>
  <li>Exporters: runs on the targets so data retrieval can scrape the metrics</li>
  <li>Push Gateway: for short lived jobs that cannot wait till the data retrievals pull the metrics so the gateway pushes stores the metrics till the data retrieval workers pull the data</li>
  <li>Service Discovery: Dynamically update the list of target to monitor</li>
  <li>Alert manager: to send alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Collecting Metrics</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Prometheus collects metrics by sending http requests to /metrics endpoint of each target by default&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the system has no metrics endpoint use exporter process to collect metrics and exposing /metrics endpoint</li>
  <li>client libraries allow to expose any application metrics for promethues for different languages like go and python</li>
</ul>
