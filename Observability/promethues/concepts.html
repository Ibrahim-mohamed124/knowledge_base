<h1>Intro to Observability</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to understand and measure the state of a system based upon data generated by the system</li>
  <li>It allows to generate actionable outputs from unexpected scenarios in dynamic environments and help in<ul>
      <li>Better insights into the internal working of a system</li>
      <li>speed up troubleshooting</li>
      <li>Monitor performance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unlike monolithic application microservices applications are much more complex</li>
  <li>it gives us answers for<ul>
      <li>error rates</li>
      <li>high latency</li>
      <li>timing outs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Pillars of Observability</h3>
<ol>
  <li>logging:<ul>
      <li>Records of events that have occurred and encapsulated information about the specific event with timestamps&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>metrics:<ul>
      <li>numeric data about the system that contain:<ul>
          <li>Metric name</li>
          <li>Value of the metric</li>
          <li>Timestamp</li>
          <li>Dimensions: more data about the mertic</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Traces:<ul>
      <li>allow to follow operations as they traverses through various systems &amp; services hop by hop to understand the whole picture&nbsp;<ul>
          <li>trace ID: the unique id for a trace&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Spans: evens in the trace and contain start time of the span, duration, and parent id</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
