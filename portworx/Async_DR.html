  <p>All worker nodes in the source and destination clusters must be able to access the Kubernetes API endpoints (port 6443)</p>
  <p>For an OpenShift based distribution, the source and destination clusters must be able to access ports in the <mark class="marker-yellow">17001–17020 range to enable communication between Portworx worker nodes.</mark></p>
  <p>A <mark class="marker-yellow">maximum of one StorageClass object is configured as the default</mark>. Having multiple default StorageClasses causes PVC migrations to fail.</p>
