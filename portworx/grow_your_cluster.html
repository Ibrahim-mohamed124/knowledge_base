<p>😕 Now without autopilot you have to expand the cluster by yourself, and there are two methods to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add new drives: All drives in the pool need to be resized to the same size for this operation.</li>
  <li>Resize existing drives: The new drive(s) will need to match the existing drives in size and IOPS properties (if available).<ul>
      <li>a significant amount of data movement to restriped the disks</li>
      <li>the pool runs in degraded mode during the <code>add-drive</code> operation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <ul>
    <li>Portworx does not support the <code>add-drive</code> operations with the PX-StoreV2 backend.</li>
  </ul>
