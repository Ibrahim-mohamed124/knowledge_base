<h1>key architecture decisions</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Type of Installation Environment</strong> – <strong>Air-gapped or Non-air-gapped</strong>:<ul>
      <li>In air-gapped mode, you’ll need to mirror all container images and Helm charts into a private registry and pre-stage any CRDs or operator bundles.</li>
      <li>In non-air-gapped mode, Portworx Enterprise automatically pulls the necessary images and updates from public registries</li>
      <li><strong>Type of deployment - Disaggregated or Converged:</strong>&nbsp;<ul>
          <li>Portworx is converged by default to sperate storage from compute designate your nodes as storage and storage less (for compute) before installation by adding necessary labels to make sure Portworx identifies the disaggregated setup.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
