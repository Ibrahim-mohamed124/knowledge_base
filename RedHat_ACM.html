<h1>Chapter one ~ Air</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The RHACM multicluster global hub enables centralized control of large-scale Kubernetes environments. Centralized control, policy enforcement, and integration with observability tools address the complexities of multicluster architectures.</li>
  <li>First at all it is only useful for large global enterprises with hybrid infrastructure because ACM has the ability to manage clusters in different platforms, but most implementations in Egypt is for small companies.</li>
  <li>It might be useful for these reasons:<ul>
      <li>RHACM platform compatibility, such as with x86 or Arm, ensures that<strong> legacy workloads</strong> run efficiently in private clouds. By managing OpenShift virtualization across different OpenShift clusters</li>
      <li>RHACM optimizes resource allocation across hybrid clouds to control expenses.</li>
      <li>RHACM enforces policies to meet <strong>compliance </strong>across private and public clouds.</li>
      <li><strong>cohesive IT infrastructure</strong>: blend public, private, and on-premise resources</li>
      <li>RHACM: Provides <strong>cluster lifecycle management</strong> from creation to destruction&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>∅ <strong>Scalability</strong>: Large cluster fleets overwhelm a single management hub, which requires division into smaller groups, <strong>with a hub to manage each group.</strong></p>
<h2>Core Components of the global ACM</h2>
<p>∅ <strong>Manages other ACMs</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Global hub operator: &nbsp;Control the lifecycle of global hub components such as global hub manager, Garfana, Kafka, Postgresql and &nbsp;global hub agent on the managed hub clusters</li>
  <li>Global hub manager: Inputs data from Kafka into Postgresql, and it posts data into Kafka for managing hub clusters</li>
  <li>Global hub agent: Runs on the managed hub cluster to gather data for the Global hub manager&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Global hub visualization: exposed by a route and provides info about clusters health, violations, compliance, and performance</li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;Design</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Storage: PostgreSQL requires at least 20&nbsp;GB to store data for three managed hubs with 250 clusters and 50 policies for 18 months.</li>
  <li>Networking: use secure HTTPS communication on port 443 for Grafana, Kafka, and PostgreSQL to ensure reliable connectivity.</li>
  <li>Middleware Integration: Organizations integrate existing Kafka version 3.4+, PostgreSQL version 13+, or Grafana instances instead of provided ones, to configure secrets and access appropriately.</li>
  <li>Access Control: The <code><strong>cluster-admin</strong></code> role remains necessary for installation, and <strong>Grafana access aligns with OpenShift console authentication</strong>. (depends on the same authentication of managed clusters?)</li>
</ul>
