<h1>OpenShift Observability</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>OpenShift Logging: </strong>Red&nbsp;Hat OpenShift Logging <mark class="marker-yellow">aggregates all the logs</mark> from the pods and nodes of an OpenShift cluster to a centralized location. Centralized logging improves searching, visualizing, and reporting of data.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenShift Monitoring: </strong>Red&nbsp;Hat OpenShift Monitoring<mark class="marker-yellow"> provides monitoring for core platform components</mark>.</li>
  <li><strong>Network Observability: </strong>Network observability monitors and<mark class="marker-yellow"> analyzes network traffic and helps to resolve connectivity issues.</mark></li>
  <li><strong>Distributed Tracing: </strong>Distributed tracing <mark class="marker-yellow">collects observability data in distributed systems. </mark>Distributed tracing is based on the OpenTelemetry project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>OpenShift Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The cluster monitoring operator manages the monitoring components and ensures that they are always available and updated.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The default monitoring stack does not support custom metrics for user-defined projects.</li>
  <li>Optionally, it is possible to configure custom metrics for user-defined projects and to configure persistent storage to have history of metrics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>OpenShift Monitoring Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The OpenShift monitoring stack is based on the Prometheus open source project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
