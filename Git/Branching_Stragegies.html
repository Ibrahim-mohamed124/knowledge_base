<h1>Branching Strategies in Git</h1>
<ul>
  <li>A set of rules or guidelines that development teams use to manage the process of writing, merging, and deploying code with the help of a version control system like Git</li>
  <li>Strategies like these are essential as they help in keeping project repositories organized, error-free, and avoid the unwanted merge conflicts when multiple developers simultaneously push and pull code from the same repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common strategies&nbsp;</h2>
<h4>Gitflow workflow</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Enables parallel development, allowing developers to work separately on feature branches.</li>
  <li>A feature branch is created from a <u>master branch</u>, and after completion of changes the feature branch is merged with the master branch.</li>
  <li>Branches:<ul>
      <li>Master &gt; product release</li>
      <li>Dev &gt; ongoing development</li>
      <li>Feature &gt; from dev to prepare for production releases</li>
      <li>Hotfix &nbsp; &gt; from the master to address urgent issues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Master and Develop branches are the main branches that remain throughout the journey of the software. The other branches are supporting branches and are short-lived that serving specific purposes.</li>
</ul>

        <td>Harder to debug</td>
      </tr>

        <td>Facilitate the release management process</td>
        <td>GitFlow's complexity makes it less suitable for CI/CD</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>reduce conflicts&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

<h4>GitHub Flow</h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>GitHub</u> flow only has feature branches that stem directly from the master branch and are merged back to master after completing changes.</li>
  <li>The fundamental concept of this model revolves around maintaining the master code in a consistently deployable condition. Which enables the seamless implementation of faster release cycles, continuous integration and delivery workflows.<ul>
      <li><strong>Master: </strong>The GitHub Flow starts with the master branch, which contains the most recent stable code ready for release.</li>
      <li><strong>Feature: </strong>Developers initiate feature branches from the main branch to implement new features or address bugs.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>If a<u> merge conflict </u>arises, developers are required to resolve it prior to finalizing the merge.</p>
