<h1>Branching Strategies in Git</h1>
<ul>
  <li>A set of rules or guidelines that development teams use to manage the process of writing, merging, and deploying code with the help of a version control system like Git</li>
  <li>Strategies like these are essential as they help in keeping project repositories organized, error-free, and avoid the unwanted merge conflicts when multiple developers simultaneously push and pull code from the same repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common strategies&nbsp;</h2>
<h4>Gitflow workflow</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Enables parallel development, allowing developers to work separately on feature branches.</li>
  <li>A feature branch is created from a <u>master branch</u>, and after completion of changes the feature branch is merged with the master branch.</li>
  <li>Branches:<ul>
      <li>Master &gt; product release</li>
      <li>Dev &gt; ongoing development</li>
      <li>Feature &gt; from dev to prepare for production releases</li>
      <li>Hotfix &nbsp; &gt; from the master to address urgent issues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Master and Develop branches are the main branches that remain throughout the journey of the software. The other branches are supporting branches and are short-lived that serving specific purposes.</li>
</ul>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h4>GitHub Flow</h4>
<ul>
  <li><u>GitHub</u> flow only has feature branches that stem directly from the master branch and are merged back to master after completing changes.</li>
  <li>The fundamental concept of this model revolves around maintaining the master code in a consistently deployable condition. Which enables the seamless implementation of faster release cycles, continuous integration and delivery workflows.<ul>
      <li><strong>Master: </strong>The GitHub Flow starts with the master branch, which contains the most recent stable code ready for release.</li>
      <li><strong>Feature: </strong>Developers initiate feature branches from the main branch to implement new features or address bugs.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>If a<u> merge conflict </u>arises, developers are required to resolve it prior to finalizing the merge.</p>

      <tr>
        <td>Pros</td>
        <td>Cons</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>fast, streamlined branching, short production cycles and frequent releases, aligning well with Agile methodologies.</td>

        <td>The lack of development branches can lead to unstable production code if changes are not properly tested before merging.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Testing and automating changes to a single branch enable quick and continuous deployment.</td>
        <td>Without separate development branches, the master branch can become cluttered, serving both production and development purposes.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>GitHub Flow is particularly well-suited for small teams and web applications,&nbsp;</td>
        <td>merge conflicts may occur more frequently due to everyone merges into the same branch.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h3>GitLab Flow</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Master:</strong> Main production branch housing stable release ready code.</li>
  <li><strong>Develop:</strong> Contains new features and bug fixes.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature: </strong>Developers initiate feature branches from the develop branch to implement new features or address bugs. Upon completion, they integrate the changes from the feature branch into the develop branch.</li>
  <li><strong>Release:</strong> Prior to a new release, a release branch is created from the develop branch.</li>
</ul>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Pros</td>
        <td>Cons</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>This approach ensures a distinct separation between code under development and production-ready code</td>
        <td>GitLab Flow may pose challenges due to its complexity</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>reducing conflicts during integration into the main codebase.</td>
        <td>Merging feature branches into the develop branch can result in conflicts, as these branches may diverge from the develop branch over time.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>work concurrently on different features</td>
        <td>The GitLab Flow strategy may slow down development, as it requires merging changes into the develop branch before release</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<h3>Trunk Based Development</h3>
<ul>
  <li>developers work on a single "<strong>trunk</strong>" branch, mostly the master branch and use feature flags to isolate features until they are ready for release.</li>
  <li>The main idea behind this strategy is to make small, frequent changes to avoid merge conflicts and limit long-lasting branches.</li>
  <li>This strategy enables continuous integration and delivery</li>
</ul>
