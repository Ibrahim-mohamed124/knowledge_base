<h1>Branching Strategies in Git</h1>
<ul>
  <li>A set of rules or guidelines that development teams use to manage the process of writing, merging, and deploying code with the help of a version control system like Git</li>
  <li>Strategies like these are essential as they help in keeping project repositories organized, error-free, and avoid the unwanted merge conflicts when multiple developers simultaneously push and pull code from the same repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common strategies&nbsp;</h2>
<h4>Gitflow workflow</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Enables parallel development, allowing developers to work separately on feature branches.</li>
  <li>A feature branch is created from a <u>master branch</u>, and after completion of changes the feature branch is merged with the master branch.</li>
  <li>Branches:<ul>
      <li>Master &gt; product release</li>
      <li>Dev &gt; ongoing development</li>
      <li>Feature &gt; from dev to prepare for production releases</li>
      <li>Hotfix &nbsp; &gt; from the master to address urgent issues&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Master and Develop branches are the main branches that remain throughout the journey of the software. The other branches are supporting branches and are short-lived that serving specific purposes.</li>
</ul>
