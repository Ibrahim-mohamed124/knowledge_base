<h1>What is Artifactory</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Artifactory is a binary repository manager used to store, manage, and distribute software packages and artifacts.<ul>
      <li>It acts as a storage system for compiled applications, libraries, and dependencies needed in software development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <tr>
        <td>Blueprint Repository (Source Code) → Stores the raw code written by developers.</td>
        <td>Product Warehouse (Built Software) → Stores compiled software packages, libraries, Docker images, etc.</td>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Problems Before Artifactory:</strong><br>• Version Confusion — Developers didn’t know if they were using the latest version.<br>• Slow Development — Every team stored files differently, leading to inconsistencies.<br>• Security Issues — No centralized control over what gets stored and used.</li>
  <li><strong>How Artifactory Solves These Issues:</strong><br>• Acts as a central storage for software artifacts.<br>• Keeps versions organized (like a library for software packages).<br>• Makes sharing and retrieving packages easy and fast.<br>• Ensures security and access control over stored artifacts.</li>
</ul>
